# A study on flight delays using R: (BANA 8090)	
This was the final project for the data wrangling in R class that I took for the MS business analytics program in the Univeristy of Cincinnati.

To see the final project: http://rpubs.com/vallesan/336775



In this project, I perform data analysis using R on more than 7,000,000 flights that took place in the United States during 2015 and I	propose recommendations on what airlines, airports and months to fly to minimize delays



The R file attached is the R markdown that I used to present my project. To access to The CSV files that I used to perform the analysis, you can go to the following link:https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays
