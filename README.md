# Rproject
To acess the final project: http://rpubs.com/vallesan/336775
This was the final project for the data wrangling in R class that I took for the MS business analytics program in the Univeristy of Cincinnati.





In this project, I perform data analysis using R on more than 7,000,000 flights that took place in the United States during 2015 and I	propose recommendations on what airlines, airports and months to fly to minimize delays
